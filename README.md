*Preface: I am totally inexperienced with PCB Design, this is all generally done for fun.  
I have made the Through Hole boards the same height as SMD (30.5) to allow for Ground Trace routing between GPIO and edge.  
These boards are designed without stacking capability.  
Also should be compatible with full size Pi (Display port keepout)
